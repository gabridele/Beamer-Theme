# Beamer theme - University of Trento

This repository is a fork from the work of Giacomo Borin and Leonardo Errati. Here you can find an implementation for the CIMeC department.

This project aims to code a LaTeX beamer theme for master's & bachelor's degrees of the University of Trento (Italy), but also to provide a quasi-official theme for professors, students, et cetera working or studying at UniTn. As of now, this is a _non-official_ project. The theme will follow current guidelines for style and impagination.

Latest (original) version: `v0.2-beta2`, may 2021

Latest forked version: June 2024

**colours & themes:** The theme is currently available only in **math**, **physisc**, and **cimec** versions.

## HOW TO USE:
The second beta release is available! However, the project is still marked as incomplete... therefore you might run into some issues.

In order to use it you will have to 
1. insert in your main folder the .sty files you will find here,
2. add into an `images` folder the images you'll also find here,
3. call as usual the `\usetheme{beunitn}` command in your beamer document; this will require setting the right options, i.e. `\usetheme[math]{beunitn}`, `\usetheme[physics]{beunitn}` or `\usetheme[cimec]{beunitn}`.

You should be able to fully customize the theme according to your personal preferences. Read below to learn about the dummy test(s) of its functionality.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE: 
It is possible to contribute to the development by testing the package and informing us of possible errors or limitations. 

Check `tests/HOW_TO_USE` for some dummy tests of the package, you will find an interesting variety of them.

## NOTES:
This theme is currently incomplete, but it's already possible to use it; be warned you'll may encounter some unresolved issues. It is also possible to just test it (see: `tests` folder).
