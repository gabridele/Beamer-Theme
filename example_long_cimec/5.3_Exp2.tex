\begin{itemize}
    \item After \textbf{tool use}, participants were significantly \textbf{faster} in correctly processing object relatives. 
    \item Performance for object relatives \textbf{did not} significantly change for the two \textbf{control groups}.
    \item A significant improvement was found for \textbf{simpler syntactic structures}.
    \item Nevertheless, they were \textbf{equivalent} among the three groups

\begin{itemize}
    \item Training to use a tool \textbf{improved} syntactic abilities in a linguistic task. 
    \item Depended on the individualsâ€™ initial syntactic level $\rightarrow$ those showing \textbf{better syntactic skills} before training.
